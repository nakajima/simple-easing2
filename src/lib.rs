//! This package contains a set of simple easing functions. That consume a standardised `time`
//! attribute in the range between `0.0` and `1.0`, that represent the progress of a transition.
//! `0.0` being the beginning, `1.0` the end.
//!
//! They return a value between `0.0` and `1.0` (it might exceed the `0..=1` range temporarily
//! for a bounce effect). The returned value can be used to interpolate between the initial
//! (`0.0`) and the final (`1.0`) transition state, allowing for a "more natural" feel of
//! a transition by accelerating and decelerating at certain points, depending on the easing
//! function used.
//!
//! Visit [easings.net](https://easings.net/) to see visualisations of the different
//! easing functions.
//!
//! All easing functions have the same signature (`(f32) -> f32`) and can be easily stored as
//! fn pointers.
//!
//! ```
//! use simple_easing::linear;
//! let easing: fn(f32) -> f32 = linear;
//! assert_eq!(easing(1.0), 1.0);
